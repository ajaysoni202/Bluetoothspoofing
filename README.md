# Bluetoothspoofing
I created a script for Bluetooth spoofing, which allows the simulation of different Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. This script can mimic the MAC address and device characteristics of legitimate BLE devices, making it useful for testing, security research, and analyzing how systems interact with spoofed peripherals.
